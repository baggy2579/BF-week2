# Business Forecasting Week 2 assignment:

This repository contains the analysis of an employee satisfaction survey, with data stored in the Excel file `Typical_Employee_Survey_Data.xlsx`. The survey captures various factors like age, gender, job satisfaction, promotion likelihood, and coworker relations. 
The analysis includes generating 5-point summaries, creating boxplots, histograms, bar charts, and a scatter plot to examine the relationship between `Age` and `Years Worked`. The final output is generated in an HTML report using R Markdown, presenting insights from the survey data.
